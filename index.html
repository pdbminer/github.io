    <h1>Patrick Miner</h1>
    <p>Hello, I’m Patrick, a PhD student in geography at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk">the University of Edinburgh</a>. My research focuses on transportation and land use in the context of climate change, equity, and human and environmental health. I’m part of the Institute of Geography in the School of GeoSciences at Edinburgh. My funding comes from the UK government’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) via the Edinburgh Earth, Ecology, and Environment Doctoral Training Partnership.</p>
    <p>Previously, I worked in geography and urban planning in Chicago. Before starting PhD research, I was a Geographic Information Science (GIS) Analyst at <a href="https://www.iff.org">IFF</a>, a nonprofit community development organisation. For six years, I worked at the <a href="https://www.architecture.org">Chicago Architecture Center</a>, where I led this museum-like organisation’s research and communications teams.</p>
    <p>My master’s degree is in geography from the University of Edinburgh. My undergraduate degree is in history and linguistics (with a minor in math) from <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu">Lawrence University</a>. I studied writing at <a href="https://www.interlochen.org">Interlochen Arts Academy</a> and grew up in Michigan, USA.</p>
