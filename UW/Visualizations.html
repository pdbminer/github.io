<h1 id="Intro">UW messaging survey analysis</h1>
<p>In March 2021, UW received 761 responses from a SurveyMonkey panel targeted to the Chicago metro area (and balanced based on basic census demographics). Simultaneously, UW received 365 responses from an internal survey distributed to the UW email newsletter list. The following results are compiled from both surveys. Unless otherwise noted, percentages displayed under or alongside a given messaging scenario refer to the top 2 box score for a scenario (e.g. "73% of respondents responded with "more likely" or "much more likely" to the Connected scenario").</p>
<p>To view a copy of the survey, select the button below or <a href="https://pdbminer.github.io/UW/UWsurvey.pdf">visit this link</a>.</p>
<button type="button" id="Button" onclick="document.location='https://pdbminer.github.io/UW/UWsurvey.pdf'" title="View survey">View survey</button>
<p><br><br></p>

<h1 id="MessagingScenarios">Messaging scenarios</h1>
<p>Seven messaging scenarios were tested in the surveys. The panel survey excluded the Corporate scenario. Respondents were asked: "Please indicate how reading the following descriptions changes your likelihood of supporting United Way of Metro Chicago. In other words, are you more likely, the same, or less likely to support United Way after reading each description?" They were given these options: Much less likely, Less likely, The same / no change, More likely, Much more likely.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Connected:</b> United Way helped create Chicago Connected, a $50 million program that provides income-qualified Chicago Public School students with free broadband service for 4 years so that they can participate in virtual learning and have improved access to online academic support and programs.</li>
  <li><b>COVID:</b> United Way was the lead partner in creating the Chicago COVID-19 Response Fund which raised $35 million and distributed 100% of it to organizations in the Chicago region providing direct assistance to nonprofit organizations and families experiencing economic hardship during the pandemic.</li>
  <li><b>Basic Needs:</b> United Way is one of the Chicago region’s largest funders of basic needs—investing millions annually in community organizations around the Chicago region that help families meet their basic needs such as food, healthcare, employment programs, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Holiday:</b> United Way has created community programs such as Uniting for the Holidays that distributed holiday meal boxes and toys to 3,000 suburban families. Another example is April Food Day, a spring food drive, which collects more than 100,000 pounds of food for south suburban food pantries.</li>
  <li><b>Equity:</b> United Way has created a Racial Equity Fund to provide funding and training to develop and strengthen Black and Brown-led community organizations.</li>
  <li><b>Networks:</b> United Way invests millions each year in 10 community-led coalitions that are driving place-based economic development to improve their neighborhoods.</li>
  <li><b>Corporate:</b> United Way encourages for-profit companies to bring their corporate assets to a neighborhood while working hand-in-hand with neighborhood representatives. For example, this initiative could help neighborhood leaders bring manufacturing and warehouse businesses to their communities that would create jobs and drive the local economy.</li>
</ol>
<p><br><br></p>

<h2>Scenarios (panel)</h2>
<p>In the panel survey, the Holiday scenario had the best top 2 box and Basic Needs had the lowest bottom 2 box, i.e. it was the “least offensive.” Equity had the lowest top 2 box and the highest bottom 2 box, i.e. it was the lowest ranked overall.<br><br></p>

<h2>Scenarios (internal)</h2>
<p>In the internal survey, COVID did best on both top 2 and bottom 2 box measures, so it was the highest ranked and the “least offensive.” Holiday had the lowest top 2 box. Meanwhile Equity had the worst bottom 2 box score and the best score for “much more likely”—it was the most divisive of the seven scenarios.</p>
<p>Both the internal and panel groups rank the Equity and Networks scenarios lower than the first three: Connected, COVID, and Basic Needs. The biggest difference between the two groups is in their ranking of Holiday. The panel rated it highest while the internal group rated it lowest (based on top 2 box).<br><br></p>

<h1 id="WorkTypes">Work types</h1>
<p>This table shows the four work types and the number of responses for both the panel and internal surveys. The panel group is somewhat evenly distributed among the four categories, but the internal survey is mainly office workers (73%). There are not enough responses from the manual and service work groups to use in segmentation, but we could combine manual, service, and blanks together (which would be 28 responses) if that would be of interest.<br><br></p>

<h2>Scenarios by work type (panel)</h2>
<p>This color-coded table shows the scenarios by work type top 2 box scores. In the panel survey, we see the full range of four work types. Manual workers strongly favored the Holiday scenario and the other five scenarios received very similar scores from them. Service workers also strongly favored the Holiday scenario but they gave higher scores for Equity and Networks than did the manual workers. The office workers favored Connected followed by COVID and Basic Needs. Responses from the other workers group were flatter across the scenarios, but they scored Basic Needs highest.<br><br></p>

<h1 id="WorkSectors">Work sectors</h1>
<p>15 work sectors were included in the surveys. The panel group included more respondents who are not currently working, either due to retirement, unemployment, or other reasons. In the panel survey, the most common work sectors were education (11.6%) and healthcare or pharmaceutical (7.5%). In the internal survey, the top sectors were nonprofit (37.0%), financial and banking (12.6%), and education (9.9%).<br><br></p>

<h2>Scenarios by work sector (panel)</h2>
<p>The panel survey included enough responses to evaluate most of the sectors on their own. Several trends are visible. Two groups preferred the Connected scenario: construction and manufacturing and financial and banking. The first three scenarios, Connected, COVID, and Basic Needs, were favored by the government group, the IT or research group, and the education group. The Holiday scenario was favored by three groups: professional services, retail and restaurants, and other. The retired group gave the lowest scores overall and, in particular, they did not like the Equity scenario.<br><br></p>

<p>Sector groups were also evaluated. The nonprofit group was excluded due to few responses. When grouped, sector trends are less apparent. The most noticeable trend is that the retail, restaurants, and hospitality group strongly favored Holiday. The education and government group favored Connected, COVID, and Basic Needs. Three groups reacted somewhat negatively to the Equity scenario.<br><br></p>

<h2>Scenarios by work sector (internal)</h2>
<p>The retail, restaurants, hospitality group was excluded due to few responses. The construction group rated many of the scenarios similarly, but they were least interested in Networks. The education and government group favored Equity and Basic Needs. They were least interested in Holiday. The finance, professional services, etc. group slightly favored the first three scenarios: Connected, COVID, and Basic Needs. The nonprofit group, which is the largest among the internal respondents, scored most scenarios highly. They slightly favored Equity and COVID and were less interested in Holiday.</p>
<p>In both surveys, the finance, professional services, etc. group favored Connected and scored the other scenarios fairly highly. Also in both surveys, the not employed, retired, other group scored the first four scenarios higher than 5 and 6 (Equity and Networks). The construction group’s responses are nearly inverted between the two surveys. The education and government group scored Equity highest in the internal survey and lowest for the panel survey. However, in both surveys, the education and government group responded well to Basic Needs and COVID.<br><br></p>

<h1 id="RaceAndEthnicity">Race and ethnicity</h1>
<p>Both surveys received a disproportionately large number of responses from white people. About 52% of Chicago metro residents are white, while 60-63% of survey respondents were white. The panel survey was well-balanced in terms of responses from Black, Asian, Native American, and unlisted (“other”) groups, but it received too few responses from Latinx people. The internal survey was well-balanced in terms of Black, Native American, and unlisted groups, but it received too few responses from Latinx and Asian people. For the scenarios analysis, several race and ethnicity categories had to be grouped due to small numbers.<br><br></p>

<h2>Scenarios by opinion of UW (panel)</h2>
<p>Among panel participants, the clearest trend is that those with a negative impression of UW strongly favored the Holiday scenario above the other options. Those with a positive impression rated all scenarios highly, but they slightly favored Holiday. Panelists who were unfamiliar with UW responded well to Basic Needs, Connected, and COVID. The group most unfamiliar with UW did not like the Holiday scenario, whereas the group that had heard of UW but not the local organization rated this scenario highest. The final group, those who had heard of UW but didn’t have an opinion, rated all the scenarios about the same albeit with a slight preference for Connected and a disinterest in Networks.<br><br></p>

<h2>Scenarios by opinion of UW (internal)</h2>
<p>In the internal survey, two of the five levels were excluded due to low response counts: “never heard of it” and the “negative impression” option. Those with a positive impression rated all of the scenarios highly except the Holiday scenario. Those unfamiliar with UW responded best to Basic Needs, Connected, COVID, and Equity.</p>
<p>In both surveys, those unfamiliar with UW responded well to the first three scenarios: Connected, COVID, and Basic Needs. Also in both surveys, those who had heard of UW (but didn’t have an opinion) responded well to Connected. One of the biggest differences is in the rating of the Holiday scenario. The panelists with a positive impression of UW liked it best, while the internal group with a positive impression liked it least.<br><br></p>

<h1 id="Donation">Donation</h1>
<p>Predictably, more internal respondents “donate to organizations that support families and communities…” In the internal survey, nearly 89% donate to these types of organizations. In the panel survey, 61% do. According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/310880/percentage-americans-donating-charity-new-low.aspx">2020 Gallup poll</a>, 73% of Americans donate to charity. This figure includes all charitable organizations, of which religious entities make up the largest portion.

<h2>Scenarios by donation (internal)</h2>
<p>The donating group rated all except one scenario (Holiday) higher than the non-donating group. Those who donate responded about equally well to all of the scenarios except Holiday, which scored about 10% lower than the rest. The non-donating group favored Connected followed by Holiday and COVID. They rated Corporate lowest.</p>
<p>As expected, the donating group gave higher ratings in both surveys. Once again the panel and internal groups disagreed on the Holiday scenario. Panelists who donate rated it highly. Internal respondents who donate rated it lowest.<br><br></p>

<h1 id="Summary">Summary</h1>
<p>The seven messaging scenarios scored fairly closely to each other based on top 2 box and bottom 2 box. The differences between the scenarios are more apparent when broken down by demographic factors like location, age, and work type. Another way to pull out the differences between scenarios is looking at top 2 box scores minus bottom 2 box scores to create a net score.</p>
<p>Based on net scores, the Holiday and Basic Needs scenarios performed best in the panel survey. In the internal survey, COVID and Basic Needs scored highest. With both surveys together, the Basic Needs message scored best.<br><br></p>
